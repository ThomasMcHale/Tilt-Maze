# Tilt-Maze
Project 1 for CMSC425

This repository holds my Unity project for the Tilt Maze assignment for CMSC425. It will be updated to include part 2 in a later commit.
I did not upload any Library files or game builds.

Extra credit:

Not much, but the goal gets randomly placed - just like the pickups. It won't share space with a pickup.
